# AI Tool Optimization Guide

## Problem Analysis

Your project was experiencing issues with AI assistants like Kiro Code and Copilot due to several factors:

### 1. **Massive Project Complexity**
- **Node modules**: 503MB (32,335 files) - extremely large dependency tree
- **Complex architecture**: Multiple providers, performance monitoring systems, memory optimization
- **Heavy dependencies**: Three.js (600KB), Framer Motion (180KB), Vanta.js
- **Extensive code splitting**: 20+ lazy-loaded components with complex dependency resolution

### 2. **Performance Monitoring Overhead**
- Real-time memory leak detection
- Bundle analysis on every build
- Component performance profiling
- Web vitals tracking
- Multiple monitoring systems running simultaneously

### 3. **Complex State Management**
- Multiple context providers nested deeply
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Memory optimization systems
- Accessibility providers with complex state

### 4. **Heavy CSS & Styling**
- 1,941 lines of CSS with complex animations
- Multiple theme systems
- Accessibility-focused styling with high contrast modes
- Performance-impacting animations

### 5. **Development-Only Imports**
```typescript
// These cause issues for AI tools
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  import("@/utils/validateHoverStates");
  import("@/utils/testHoverStates");
}
```
